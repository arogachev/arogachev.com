  text: Alexey contributed significantly to Yii PHP framework last year. I can mention that his communication style
    stands out. Very calm and reasonable. Mind is sharp about problem-solving and approaches are good. Based on best
    practices and experience. Besides regular PHP stuff he did a very important job of refactoring JavaScript part and
    covering it with automated tests properly which usually is the part lazy developers try to avoid. It was a pleasure
    to work with him and I hope to do it again.
