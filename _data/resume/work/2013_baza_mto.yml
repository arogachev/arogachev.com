    using Silex.
  - Work on public company job service - job.fora.kz (development from scratch, support). Built with Yii 2.
  - Work on internal ERP system - development from scratch according to company specifics and needs. Built with Yii
    2 and PostgreSQL. Modules development and support. Synchronization with 1C. System was introduced and required
    for usage for every employee.

highlights:
  - &erp_testing
    Developed "Testing" module for ERP system which was intented to periodically check professional suitability and
    knowledge of employees from different departments. It can handle pretty complex types of tests, filling data is
    possible with either easy-to-use GUI (AngularJS based) or importing Excel file using yii2-excel extension which
    I developed during work on this module. Test passing also involves a lot of JavaScript for better UX. Detailed
    statistics is avalable for inspectors.
  - &erp_graph
    Implemented subordination graph for ERP system to be able to get each employee's chiefs and subordinates based
    on data in 1C. The structure couldn't be presented as tree (employee could have multiple chiefs, relations were
    set using different factors - departments, geographical location, etc.). This graph then was integrated into
    permission system to regulate access of different employees to specific parts of the application.
  - Implemented "Procedural Tasks" module for ERP system for setting and tracking periodical tasks for employees.
  - &erp_deferred_tasks
    Implemented deferred tasks functionality to run tasks for specific employye(s) at specific date and time. Such
    tasks include setting of auto remarks and sending notifications. Used Redis and Supervisor. This took off a lot
    of additional load from the server (cron was used before) and tasks began to run more precisely and in due time.
  - Created component for building complex forms (multiple related formsets with dynamic number of additional forms
    in it) and used it in few projects.
  - Developed model life cycle component, used it mostly in guarantee and repair service project.
  - Implemented algorithm of calculating business days in given date range and used it for statistics in fora.kz
    site.
  - Automated deploy of the projects using Deployer.

  - fora.kz helped to increase sales and company's income in certain periods of time.
  - &job_service_results
    With appearing of job.fora.kz the number of sent resume was increased.
  - With distribution of internal projects many processes inside of the company was optimized and work of employees
    became more automated.
  - After adding tracking of working hours and adding remarks system in ERP (which affects salary) working
    discipline became better, number of cases of coming late was reduced. Encouragements system helped employees to
    be more motivated.
  - After creating subordination graph and presenting new permissions system in ERP some flaws were found in company
    structure and the structure was redesigned to be more optimal.
  - ERP helped people to stay more informed, better know and communicate with each other (especially with branches).
