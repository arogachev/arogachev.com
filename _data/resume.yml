    tasks:
      - >
        Support and improvement of main public company site - fora.kz (e-commerce). It was built with Yii 1, then was
        rewritten in Yii 2 (upgrade to newer version was fully completed only after my leaving). API part was written
        using Silex.
      - Work on public company job service - job.fora.kz (development from scratch, support). Built with Yii 2.
      - >
        Work on internal ERP system - development from scratch according to company specifics and needs. Built with Yii
        2 and PostgreSQL. Modules development and support. Synchronization with 1C. System was introduced and required
        for usage for every employee.

        (including guarantee and repair service, advertising).

        possible with either easy-to-use GUI (AngularJS based) or importing Excel file using yii2-excel extension which
        I developed during work on this module. Test passing also involves a lot of JavaScript for better UX. Detailed

      - >

      - >
        Implemented deferred tasks functionality to run tasks for specific employye(s) at specific date and time. Such

        of additional load from the server (cron was used before) and tasks began to run more precisely and in due time.
      - >
        Created component for building complex forms (multiple related formsets with dynamic number of additional forms
        in it) and used it in few projects.
      - Developed model life cycle component, used it mostly in guarantee and repair service project.
      - >

      - >
        After adding tracking of working hours and adding remarks system in ERP (which affects salary) working
        discipline became better, number of cases of coming late was reduced. Encouragements system helped employees to
        be more motivated.
      - >
        After creating subordination graph and presenting new permissions system in ERP some flaws were found in company
        structure and the structure was redesigned to be more optimal.
